### File Overlap Solutions
## Exercise:Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that are overlapping. One .txt file has a list of all prime numbers under 1000, and the other .txt file has a list of happy numbers up to 1000.
## (If you forgot, prime numbers are numbers that can’t be divided by any other number. And yes, happy numbers are a real thing in mathematics - you can look it up on Wikipedia. The explanation is easier with an example, which I will describe below.)

def fileOverlap():
	primeslist = []
	with open('primenumbers.txt') as primesfile:
		line = primesfile.readline()
		while line:
			primeslist.append(int(line))
			line = primesfile.readline()
		happieslist = []
		with open('happynumbers.txt') as happiesfile:
			line = happiesfile.readline()
			while line:
				happieslist.append(int(line))
				line = happiesfile.readline()
		overlaplist = []
		for elem in primeslist:
			if elem in happieslist:
				overlaplist.append(elem)
		print(overlaplist)
